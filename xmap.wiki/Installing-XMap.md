The latest stable release of XMap is version 2.0.2 and supports Linux, macOS, and BSD. We recommend installing XMap from HEAD rather than using a distro package manager (not supported yet).

**Instructions on building XMap from source** can be found in [INSTALL](https://github.com/idealeer/xmap/blob/master/INSTALL.md).

**Installing from [docker](https://hub.docker.com/r/liii/xmap)**: `docker pull liii/xmap:latest`

**Installing from [ArchLinux Package](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/xmap-git)**
